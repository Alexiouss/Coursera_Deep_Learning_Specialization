# Deep Learning Specialization
This repository contains the code for all the **graded** excersises of the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) offered by deeplearning.ai on Coursera. 
The code for the tests and all the dependencies are deliberately missing. This repository is to be used for reference only when you get stuck in the programming assignments of the Specialization.
